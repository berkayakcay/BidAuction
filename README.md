## History
The tree main goals of the Bid Auction product are:
1. Provide a simple mechanism for buyer to bid to seller on product. The rational is that
buyers will bid if the process is easy.
2. Use bids from buyers to add value to the product and continue auction for other buyers
without intervention from the seller.
3. The system should not require any extra effort on the part of the seller or other buyer.
